# notify

A small Angular module to display status messages on NIWA Angular Apps

To install run

'bower install NIWANotify'

You will need to

* add this module as a dependency to your Angular App.
* import the JS files to your project
* set the correct URL in the notify service
' $http.get('/notifyProxy.php').then(function (response) { ...'
* Add the directive to your page

That's it.
